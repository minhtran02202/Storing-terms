# Storing-terms
A term data has the term's name, description, and a list of website. The program is design to manipulate this term data.

The program uses a hash table with chaining for resolving collision to store the terms, which can be added from an external file or inputs from the user.

The program can add new terms, display a term, add a website to an existing term, and remove a term.

# What I learned
Through this project I learned the basics of a hash table data structure and how to use chaining to resolve collision.
